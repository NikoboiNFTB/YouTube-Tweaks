# YouTube-Tweaks

A collection of user scripts and a uBlock Origin blocklist to enhance your YouTube browsing experience by customizing the interface and removing unwanted features. Also hides some of SponsorBlock's clutter.

## Overview

This repository contains several user scripts designed to tweak YouTube's interface and functionality. These scripts can be used with Tampermonkey or other compatible user script managers. Additionally, there's a uBlock Origin blocklist to block various elements from YouTube.

### Scripts Included

1. **Move Chapters Above Playlist ([install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/YouTube-Tweaks/raw/refs/heads/main/Move-Chapters-Above-Playlist-1.8.user.js))**
   - Moves YouTube's video chapters above the playlist in the video player for easier access.

2. **Un-Rounded Player ([install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/YouTube-Tweaks/raw/refs/heads/main/Square-Player-1.0.user.js))**
   - Removes the rounded borders around the YouTube player and restores sharp corners.

3. **Remove WL Banner ([install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/YouTube-Tweaks/raw/refs/heads/main/Remove-WL-Banner-1.0.user.js))**
   - Removes the "Watch Later" playlist banner and fully aligns videos to the left on the Watch Later page.

### uBlock Origin Blocklist

The repository also includes a blocklist for uBlock Origin to block various YouTube UI elements, such as:

- Paid promotion overlays
- Shorts in search results
- SponsorBlock chapter upvote/downvote buttons
- "Skip to highlight?" buttons

- And more...

To use the blocklist, simply copy the contents from the `blocklist.txt` file and import it into your uBlock Origin settings.
